      <h1 class="w3-text-teal" id="top">Building DPRR’s RDF data and server</h1>
<p>DPRR’s data is served from an
instance of the rdf4j-generated RDF repository, but weas created in a relational database.  So, to get the data from
DPRR’s relational database into a set of triples required some software, some
scripts, and a process that linked them together.  Here I will briefly describe
how this process was carried out.</p>

<h3 id="d2rq">D2RQ</h3>

<p>The package D2RQ
(<a href="http://d2rq.org/">http://d2rq.org/</a>) was the main tool used to take the data from the relational
database into a corresponding set of RDF triples.  This is, indeed, D2RQ's job: as its website says, D2RQ
“exposes the contents of relational databases as RDF”. Indeed, it
<i>has</i> been used directly to publish dynamic data (for several life sciences projects) that
is created and maintained in relational databases so that it can also be
accessed as Open RDF data.</p>

<p>Thus, D2RQ is interesting because it
can do to things that might have been directly useful for the expression of DPRR as RDF. First, it can act
as an RDF server itself, displaying data that is actually in a relational
database but presented as a collection of RDF triples. When run this way,
one can see the RDF data it is presented by connecting to it through a browser:</p>

<p><img border=0 width=602 class="w3-border w3-padding"
height=432 id="Picture 10" src="images/image009.jpg"></p>

<p>Then, looking at
one of the RDF entities shown here, say, “Office”, one is shown the URIs that
are associated with the “Office” class:</p>

<p><img border=0 width=602 class="w3-border w3-padding"
height=432 id="Picture 11" src="images/image010.jpg"></p>

<p>Choosing one of
the Offices (say, dictator), D2RQ will display the triples associated with that
office:</p>

<p><img border=0 width=602 class="w3-border w3-padding"
height=432 id="Picture 12" src="images/image011.jpg"></p>

<p>The D2RQ architecture figure provided in the D2RQ documentation shows how this works. 
We can see the HTML browser shown above as the third box on the left, and can
see how it connects to the Non-RDF Database (for DPRR, this is a Postgres
database) on the right:</p>

<p><img border=0 width=384 class="w3-border w3-padding"

alt="D2RQ Platform architecture diagram"></p>

<p>(From <a
href="http://d2rq.org/images/architecture.png">http://d2rq.org/images/architecture.png</a>)</p>

<p>Although D2RQ’s server can
represent relational data as RDF triples, DPRR, for reasons given below, does
not use the D2R Server directly to simply serve data from DPRR’s relational
database as RDF.  Instead, it uses the other service that D2RQ can offer: the
RDF dump tool that generates pure RDF in a file that can be subsequently loaded
into a separate triple store. In the diagram the path to DPRR’s triple store
comes from the bottom left box labelled “Triple Store”.</p>

<h3 id="preparing">Preparing the D2RQ mapping file</h3>

<p>A key element in the use of D2RQ
is the D2RQ Mapping File (shown in the diagram above near its centre)
which provides the D2RQ engine with the instructions (expressed as a sequence of RDF
statements) about how to translate the entities,
attributes and relationships of the relational (“non-RDF”) database into
triples. In the DPRR project work, this file is called <i>dprr-mapping.ttl</i>.</p>

<p>The information conveyed in this
file is quite rich, and it is beyond the scope of this document to explain it
in detail.  You can get the details for the “Mapping Language” that it
expresses from D2RQ’s documentation at <a href="http://d2rq.org/d2rq-language">http://d2rq.org/d2rq-language</a>.
However, a couple of short examples are still useful for us here.</p>

<p>First, let us look at a fragment that
expresses the relationship between the database table for offices and the RDF
expression of this data that D2RQ generates.  The mapping from a database table
to an RDF class is provided by an <tt>d2rq:ClassMap</tt> instance (shown here in RDF’s
turtle notation):</p>

<pre class="w3-border w3-padding">
map:Office a d2rq:ClassMap;
  d2rq:dataStorage map:database;
  d2rq:uriPattern &quot;Office/@@promrep_office.id@@&quot;;
  d2rq:class vocab:Office;
  d2rq:classDefinitionLabel &quot;Office&quot;;
.
</pre>
<p>The <code>d2rq:class</code> statement
expresses the connection for our RDF “Office” class. It specifies that each instance of the RDF Office class will
have an associated URI, and the <code>d2r1:uriPattern</code> statement provides a
template for it, in this case drawing on the id field of the database’s <code>promrep_office</code>
table.</p>

<p>The connection between attributes
in a relational database’s table, and the properties of an RDF class is
provided by a <code>d2rq:PropertyBridge</code>.  Here is a simple example:</p>

<pre class="w3-border w3-padding">
map:officeName a d2rq:PropertyBridge;
  d2rq:belongsToClassMap map:Office;
  d2rq:property vocab:hasName;
  d2rq:propertyDefinitionLabel &quot;Office name&quot;;
  d2rq:column &quot;promrep_office.name&quot;;
.
</pre>

<p>The property name for the RDF representation is given
by the <code>d2rq:property</code> statement. The connection of this property to the
Office class and table comes from the <code>d2rq:belongsToClassMap</code> statement,
and the association to the particular table’s attribute is provided by the <code>d2rq:column</code>
statement.</p>

<p>This example of a PropertyBridge
defines a property that in OWL would be considered to be a owl:DatatypeProperty, but of course
not all properties are simple DataProperties. Indeed, the 
definition for an owl:ObjectProperty must be rather different since it involves a
relational join rather than a simple reference to an attribute of a table. 
Furthermore, there are other expressions for other kinds of data from the DB
that needs to be mapped to OWL properties. We do not provide examples here, although full examples
are available from d2rq's documentation for its mapping language.</p>

<p>The entire mapping file for DPRR
consists of about 1800 lines/RDF statements.  That’s a lot of stuff to create
accurately by hand.  And so D2RQ provides a utility tool, called <code>generate-mapping</code>
that reads the structure in the relational database and creates a preliminary mapping
file that maps all the data in the relational database into instructions that
will cause D2RQ to present it.</p>

<p>Although this tool provided a
starting form for DPRR’s mapping file, it was clear to me that could not be used without being
edited significantly.  Here are the bits of RDF that corresponds to Office and officeName as it
appeared in the originally generated file:</p>

<pre class="w3-border w3-padding">
map:promrep_office a d2rq:ClassMap;
  d2rq:dataStorage map:database;
  d2rq:uriPattern &quot;promrep_office/@@promrep_office.id@@&quot;;
  d2rq:class vocab:promrep_office;
  d2rq:classDefinitionLabel &quot;promrep_office&quot;;
.

map:promrep_office_name a d2rq:PropertyBridge;
  d2rq:belongsToClassMap map:promrep_office;
  d2rq:property vocab:promrep_office_name;
  d2rq:propertyDefinitionLabel &quot;promrep_office name&quot;;
  d2rq:column &quot;promrep_office.name&quot;;
.
</pre>

<p>Note that the names for the class
and attributes are not as “user friendly” as what we have used in our mapping
file.  This is because all <code>generate-mapping</code> had to work with was the
table and attribute names in the database, and the DPRR database is actually
created and managed by <i>Django</i>, and so the naming conventions used reflect
django’s needs and are not particularly convenient to use as public names in
RDF.</p>

<p>It turns out that many changes
had to be made to the file;s text to take the raw mapping file generated by <code>generate-mapping</code>
into the form used to actually generate the RDF data used by DPRR. Among the
various issues that needed to be dealt with were:</p>

<ul>
<li>many extra tables were generated by Django for its own uses, and
did not contain data from DPRR that needed to be public.  All the material about them
needed to be removed.</li>

<li>fields were inserted by Django for various administrative
purposes such as “created by” that did not need to be published.  The
references to all these fields needed to be removed so that the data they
contained did not appear in the RDF expression of DPRR’s data.</li>

<li>Django named most DPRR data tables with the “promrep_” prefix,
and this needed to be removed.</li>

<li>Django used lowercase names only for tables and attributes, and
these needed to be converted to camelcase.</li>

<li>property names had to be changed to provide the “has”, “is” or
“for” prefix.</li>

<li>pure intersection set tables that provided many-to-many mappings in
the conventional relational paradigm way needed to be removed as classes, and
the many-to-many relationship that this intersection set table supported
instead expressed as an owl:ObjectProperty that could occur multiple times if
necessary.</li>
</ul>

<p>Furthermore, there were several
more global changes, not listed here, that had to be made to make the mapping
for DPRR work more naturally as RDF data.</p>

<p>The work to do all these by hand
would have been tedious and subject to error.  Thus, the process of fixing up the data
was expressed as a sequence of individual steps.  Those that could be automated
were carried out by little python scripts that took one version of the file in,
performed a set of automated changes, and generated a new version out.  Not all
the steps were able to be automated. In the end, there were 14 automated and by-end
steps of transformation to the mapping file.</p>

<p>In the end, however, we had a d2rq mapping file that allowed the d2rq server to present a pretty
good (but not completely satisfactory, see below) representation
of the RDF statements that were to be served by DPRR’s RDF server. The next step, then, was to
develop a process that used d2rq’s tool (called <code>dump-rdf</code>) to generate a set
of RDF statements from the database using its mapping file as a guide.</p>

<h3 id="d2rqgem">Generating RDF statements with d2rq</h3>

<p><code>Dump-rdf</code> largely generated a good
set (about a 3<sup>rd</sup> of a million) of directly usable RDF statements. 
However, there were still a few refinements that I wanted to make to this
automatically generated RDF data.</p>

<ul>
<li>The most important change was that DPRR had developed a standard
form for an historical person’s name related closely to conventions already
used by Roman Republic scholars to identify individuals.  This "standard naming convention" for DPRR persons required the
putting together of data mainly from fields in DPRR's person table, but also
from several other tables. The d2rq mapping language is quite flexible, so <i>perhaps</i>
this could have been expressed there so that d2rq would have been able to create this name directly,
but the process to build the name from DPRR data was complex enough that with my rather basic
understanding of d2rq’s mapping language I couldn’t see how get it to work. Nonetheless, it seemed
important that DPRR's names for persons be represented in the DPRR RDF, even if I couldn't see how
to create them with the d2rq mapping language.</li>

<li>Many fields in the DPRR database are empty.  D2RQ claims that it
provides a mechanism to have empty fields suppressed as RDF data, but I
couldn’t make it work.  I wanted all statements that had null or empty string
objects to be suppressed.</li>

<li>Several fields in DPRR were Boolean and reflected particular characteristics
of the things to which they were attached.  I wanted all situations where the
value for these properties were false to be suppressed. (this may turn out to
be a controversial decision)</li>

<li>The handling of the situation where a DPRR had two praenomens to
associate with a person was handled in a way that did not really suit RDF
principles, and had to be expressed differently.</li>
</ul>

<p>All these refinements on the
dumped data from d2rq could have been perhaps handled directly within <i>d2rq</i>,
resulting in a file that could be simply directly loaded into the DPRR RDF
server.  However, I chose, instead, to write a python script (called
<code>processttl.py</code>) that took the version of RDF data that dump-rdf had generated and made all the
changes outlined above, creating a new turtle file called <code>dppr_clean.ttl</code>.  It
was this file that was to be loaded into the DPRR RDF server.</p>

<h3 id="buildserver">Building the DPRR RDF server</h3>

<p>Now that we had a way to generate the RDF triples from the DPRR relational database, we needed a way to
serve them.</p>

<p>A number of different software development projects
worldwide have created toolkits for RDF servers.  I chose <a href="http://rdf4j.org/">rdf4j</a> as the platform for building
DPRR’s particular RDF server, since rdfj4 was a Java-based platform that included
many components I knew we were going to need to make DPRR’s server work in the
way I wanted.  In particular, I liked the part of <i>rdf4j</i> called the <i>workbench</i> which
operated as a Tomcat web application and that out of the various
platforms I looked at seemed to me to best provide access to the RDF data in ways that
assisted the user to grasp how the data was structured.</p>

<p>There was, however, an issue with
the <i>rdf4j workbench</i> as it came "out of the box": the workbench provided a full set of tools not only to
interact with existing RDF data but to change it too &#x2014; including allowing its user to replace or remove some or
all the RDF triples in its repository.  Furthermore, the administrative system
to manage permissions for data users in such a way that the DPRR data
administrator would be able to update the data while ordinary users could not, was
not sufficiently clearly laid out so that I was confident that I could readily
control this.</p>

<p>So, I decided to use the <i>rdf4j workbench</i>
code as the basis for DPRR’s RDF server but to make several changes
to the way that it operates “out of the box”. As a result:</p>

<ul>
<li>All features of the <i>rdf4j workbench</i> that went beyond data
exploring have been removed, including the Java classes that implement these
features.</li>

<li>The <i>rdf4j workbench</i> in the DPRR server has been directed to
work directly with RDF data in the filesystem, rather than through an
intermediate rdf4j server (which, by operating via http:, presented similar
issues of data access and control that the raw workbench did).</li>

<li>Minor changes to the look and feel, beyond the removing of
unwanted features, have been made.  The web pages “livery” is now related to DPRR’s
livery, etc etc.</li>

<li>A few classes have been developed by me to provide the data-oriented
support for URI entities, and for a direct data-oriented (rather than HTML
mediated) SPARQL endpoint. These classes that go outside the functionality
provided by the rdf4j workbench are in the JAVA package <code>uk.ac.kcl.ddh.jb.rdf.server</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>All this work was done by setting
up the <i>rdf4j workbench</i> code in Eclipse via an Eclipse “web” project, and
working on it there.  The changes were relatively minor.  The base Java code
that came from rdf4j for the workbench classes was altered in a few trivial ways.
In addition, to provide the
data-oriented services (support for entity URIs, and the basic SPARQL endpoint:
the features mentioned in the last point above) I had to add a small number of my own
classes.  Of course, the various “web content pages” had to be altered too to
bring in elements of DPRR’s livery, and to remove references to services that
the out-of-the-box <i>rdf4j workbench</i> offered but that were not to be made
available in the DPRR’s RDF server.</p>

<p>This work on the web content
pages revealed what was, to me, something interesting: the <i>rdf4j workbench</i>
operates in an unusual way as a server of pages for a web browser in that it actually makes use of
browsers that support XML and XSLT &#x2014; sending XML that
it generates as the data, with a reference to an XSLT stylesheet that, on the
browser, gets transforms into HTML for proper display. Thus, one of the
jobs I needed to do was alter the stylesheets (particularly the “template.xsl”,
but others too) to remove all HTML links to services that the DPRR RDF server
was not going to offer. In addition, unwanted functionality was removed, and
new functionality added, to the WEB-INF/web.xml file.</p>

<p>The entire Eclipse project in which DPRR's RDF server is licenced as open source through the EPL license for the Java code, and Creative
Commons for the non-Java elements.  In addition, it is available
for anyone to use through a github repository at <i>johnBradley501/uk.ac.kcl.cch.dprr.rdf.server</i></p>

<p>Having now created mechanisms to
generate the RDF data, and having built an RDF server based on the stripped
down (and somewhat extended) <i>rdf4j workbench</i>, I was ready to turn my attention
to an ontology for DPRR.</p>

<h3 id="buildont">Building the DPRR ontology</h3>

<p>I chose to use rdf4j’s memory
repository that supported RDF Schema inferencing (according to rdf4j
documentation at (<a
href="http://docs.rdf4j.org/javadoc/2.0/org/eclipse/rdf4j/sail/inferencer/fc/ForwardChainingRDFSInferencer.html">http://docs.rdf4j.org/javadoc/2.0/org/eclipse/rdf4j/sail/inferencer/fc/ForwardChainingRDFSInferencer.html</a>)
it follows the rules from the RDF Semantics Recommendations (<a
href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2004/REC-rdf-mt-20040210/#rdfs_interp">https://www.w3.org/TR/2004/REC-rdf-mt-20040210/#rdfs_interp</a>). 
Furthermore, in my view information about data in terms of a class-subclass
structure makes it easier for a human to grasp.  These two reasons, then, meant
that it was worthwhile constructing the DPRR Ontology in ways that made use of
class-subclass structuring mechanisms.  D2RQ, which generates DPRR's RDF statements, does not provide direct support
for a subclassing model, in part because the ideas in subclassing are
available, if at all, only implicitly in relational database semantics. Thus,
the class-subclass structure that is presented in DPRR’s ontology had to be
constructed by me entirely “by hand”. D2RQ is not aware of this class hierarchy
at all.</p>

<p>I chose to express the ontology
in terms of the OWL language (<a href="https://www.w3.org/OWL/">https://www.w3.org/OWL/</a>), although I only used a
few basic constructs of OWL.  You can find the DPRR ontology at:</p>

<p><a href="http://romanrepublic.ac.uk/rdf/ontology#">http://romanrepublic.ac.uk/rdf/ontology#</a></p>

<p>A certain amount of the material
(base classes and properties) in the DPRR ontology could be generated
automatically from the information D2RQ has in its mapping file.  Thus, I
loaded the DPRR mapping file, which is in RDF, into a temporary RDF store using
rdf4j’s workbench, and ran SPARQL construct queries against it to create
preliminary components of what was going to become the DPRR ontology.  The
following query, for example, created class definitions for all of d2rq’s
ClassMap constructs:</p>

<pre class="w3-border w3-padding">
PREFIX owl: http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#
PREFIX rdfs: http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#
PREFIX d2rq: http://www.wiwiss.fu-berlin.de/suhl/bizer/D2RQ/0.1#
PREFIX vocab: http://romanrepublic.ac.uk/rdf/vocab/

construct {?name a owl:Class;
   rdfs:label ?label.
}
where {
   ?a a d2rq:ClassMap;
   d2rq:class ?name;
   d2rq:classDefinitionLabel ?label;
}
</pre>

<p>This query created a <i>rdf:Property</i>
assertion and domain mapping for all <i>d2rq:PropertyBridge</i> assertions:</p>

<pre class="w3-border w3-padding">
construct {
   ?name a rdf:Property ;
      rdfs:domain ?domainName.
}
where {
   ?a a d2rq:PropertyBridge;
           d2rq:belongsToClassMap ?domainMap;
           d2rq:property ?name.
    ?domainMap d2rq:class ?domainName.
    filter (?name != rdfs:label)
}
</pre>

<p>A final example (there were
several more similar to this), created <i>rdfs:range</i> assertions for properties
that were to become OWL ObjectProperties:</p>

<pre class="w3-border w3-padding">
>construct {
   ?name rdfs:range ?rangeName.
}
where {
   ?a a d2rq:PropertyBridge;
  d2rq:property ?name;
  d2rq:refersToClassMap ?rangeMap.
    ?rangeMap d2rq:class ?rangeName.
}
</pre>

<p>After running my 5 <code>construct</code>
queries, I combined all the triple results they generated into one large file by hand, added a
basic <i>owl:Ontology</i> definition, and opened the resulting file in <i>Protégé</i>
(<a href="http://protege.stanford.edu/">http://protege.stanford.edu/</a>).</p>

<p>There was then a fair amount of
work by hand in <i>Protégé</i> to further enrich the ontology to the state that you
see it now &#x2014; in particular adding what appeared to me to be an appropriate
class-subclass structure, and adding at least a brief <i>rdfs:comment</i> field
to each class and property.</p>

<p>Once I had an owl file containing
the DPRR ontology, a reasonably readable set of documentation files for the DPRR
ontology could be generated using <i>Protégé</i>’s OWLDoc plugin, and then modified
slightly with a small Python file to fix up a few awkward bits in OWLDoc’s
generated HTML.  You can see the result at:</p>
