      <h1 class="w3-text-teal" id="top">The DPRR Ontology</h1>

<p>A basic OWL ontology has been
developed which describes the data structure of the DPRR rdf repository.  Its URI is:</p>

<p><a href="http://romanrepublic.ac.uk/rdf/ontology#"><code>http://romanrepublic.ac.uk/rdf/ontology#</code></a></p>

<p>In this part of the DPRR rdf
documentation we present an overall semantic conception of DPRR’s ontology. </p>

<p>As mentioned elsewhere, although
DPRR follows a few of the principles of the factoid prosopography model, it is
not a factoid prosopography, and so it is important to understand that DPRR’s
ontology is not based on the factoid prosopography ontology (FPO) described at 
<a href="http://factoid-dighum.kcl.ac.uk/">http://factoid-dighum.kcl.ac.uk/</a>. </p>

<p>This documentation for the
ontology is divided into three parts. </p>
<ul>
<li>First, there is a very brief description of DPRR's data model, which underpins its ontology.</li>
<li>Then, in the class hierarcy section, one gets an upper level view of the
classes in DPRR’s ontology with information about what the meanings of DPRR’s
classes are, and how these classes are linked together through subclassing, and
through data relationships (what owl calls “object properties”). These are all
described in the overview section.</li>
<li>In addition, a set of HTML pages have been generated from the owl
file that present it in a somewhat more human-readable form.  It contains
information about all the data in the owl file, thus, not only the “object
property” and subclassing characteristics described in the overview, but the other
properties that are strings and numbers that represent other kinds of data for
the class (what owl calls “data properties”) as well.   You can find this <a href="../ontology/doc/index.html">here</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="overview">Overview</h3>
<p>DPRR's RDF data is a representation of the structured data model upon which DPRR's database was created, and which is
described briefly in DPRR's <a href="http://romanrepublic.ac.uk/technical-overview/">technical pages</a>. Thus, to understand DPRR's ontology,
it is useful to first understand the simplified data structure diagram that is shown there:</p>

<img src="http://romanrepublic.ac.uk/static/media/images/dprr_model-3.width-800.png" style="margin: 20px""/>

<p>Here one can see that the overarching structure for DPRR, and hence for its ontology, involves a collection of a few kinds of 
assertions about historical people, as is drawn from various secondary (modern) prosopographical sources.  You can see this overarching
structure, extended by a more detailed structure, incorporated into the ontology, and thus shown both the ontology's class
hierarchy and class relationship diagrams presented below.</p>

<h3 id="class-hier">DPRR ontology class hierarchy</h3>
<p>The figure below presents the DPRR
Ontologies SubClass hierarchy as shown in the ontology editing software
Protégé.  Several things to note here:</p>

<img src="images/class-hierarchy.png" style="margin: 20px" align="left"/>
<ul>
<li><b>owl:Thing</b>: As one would expect for an OWL-based ontology
like DPRR, all classes are subclass of <i>owl:Thing</i></li>

<li><b>vocab:ThingWithID</b> : Furthermore, all DPRR classes
are subclasses of <i>vocab:ThingWithID</i>.  This reflects that fact that all
data in the DPRR rdf dataset comes from a relational database, and all entities
in it define a primary key which is made available in DPRR's RDF through the data property <i>vocab:hasID</i>.
</li>

<li><b>vocab:ThingWithName</b>:  About half of DPRR’s classes are
subclasses of <i>vocab:ThingWithName</i>, represent kinds of data that have a
string of characters which can be categorised as a “name” for the thing. 
People of course, have names, so <i>vocab:Person</i> appears as a subclass of <i>vocab:ThingWithName</i>. 
However, other things in DPRR have names too, and the other major kind of data
are different kinds of Authority Lists (such as lists of Offices, lists of
Praenomen, etc).  <i>vocab:ThingWithName</i> classes all have a data property <i>vocab:hasName</i>.</li>

<li><b>vocab:AuthorityList</b>: Authority lists have already been
mentioned as one kind of “Thing with name”, and represent a list of things that
might be thought of as functioning like what in library science is called an
Authority File: “A compilation of records that describe the preferred form of
headnames for use in a catalog” (<a
href="https://definedterm.com/authority_file_also_authority_list">https://definedterm.com/authority_file_also_authority_list</a>).
In DPRR not only bibiliographic objects are formed into authority lists, but
other classification schemes as well: vocab:Office, for example, has  instances
which are the names for Offices in the Roman Republic.</li>

<li><b>vocab:AuthorityWithAbbreviation</b>: One kind of Authority
List also has an associated abbreviation for each name.  <i>vocab:has
Abbreviation</i> is the property used to specify the abbreviation.</li>

<li><b>vocab:Source</b>: DPRR got most of its data from secondary
sources, but these in turn usually made reference to primary historical
sources.  Thus, the two kinds of sources are both subclasses of <b>vocab:Source</b>.
<b>N.B.:</b> Although there is some structure for primary sources in DPRR's ontology, time
was not found in the project to make use of this structure.  There is, as a
consequence, at present almost no structured data about primary sources in the DPRR rdf
repository, although this could change in any future work on DPRR.</li>

<li><b>vocab:AuthorityWithDescription</b>: Another kind of Authority
List has a property to hold a description for each Authority item.  <i>vocab:hasDescription</i>
is that property. Note that only <i>vocab:Office</i> has <i>both</i> an
abbreviation and description, and hence is a subclass of both.</li>

<li><b>Vocab:HierarchicalAuthority</b>: A third kind of Authority
List is used when the items in an authority list can be organised
hierarchically.  Authority lists of this kind all share a property <i>vocab:hasParent
</i>which allows the hierarchical structure to be presented.</li>

<li><b>vocab:Assertion</b>: The bulk of DPRR’s data are assertions
about people. Property <i>vocab:isAboutPerson</i> specifies the DPRR person who
the assertion is about. In DPRR assertions are derived from statements made in
secondary sources. So each <i>vocab:Assertion</i> also has a property <i>vocab:hasSecondarySource</i>,
The five subclasses of <i>vocab:Assertion</i> are for <i>kinds</i> of
assertions, <i>vocab:PostAssertion</i>, for example, is for an assertion made
about an office post that a DPRR person held.</li>

<li><b>vocab:AssertionWithDateRange</b>: Two types of assertions (<i>vocab:PostAssertion</i>
and <i>vocab:StatusAssertion</i>) contain dating information &#x2014; DPRR’s view of
when the person held the post or had the particular status.  Thus, this
subclass of <i>vocab:Assertion</i> also contains date range information.</li>

<li><b>vocab:NoteContainer</b>: A Note Container is a class of object
that contains a note.  A Note itself is the most basic kind of Note Container,
but other classes, which also contain other information, also contain a note
and are, therefore, Note Containers too.  DPRR used notes generally because their
secondary sources often did so to provide an explanation about why a particular
assertion was made, or to enrich the information about the thing to which the note
is attached.  All Note Contains have the <i>vocab:hasText</i> property, where
the text of the note is presented.</li>

<li><b>vocab:Note</b>: is a note itself.  Obviously, a note is also a
Note Container. SubClasses of <i>vocab:Note</i> provide classes for notes that
can be associated with other DPRR classes: Persons, Post Assertions and Status
Assertions.</li>
</ul>

<p>You will have noted that not all
the classes in the hierarchical class figure are listed above, and indeed none of the hierarchical
“leaf” classes are mentioned.  The ones that are in this figure express a
hierarchical clustering that brings classes with certain common semantic
characteristics together. The other classes, not described above, are derived
directly from DPRR’s database tables. Their semantics are given in the detailed
formal description of the ontology generated by OWLDoc and found <a href="../ontology/doc/index.html">here</a>.</p>

<h3 id="relationships">Ontology Class Relationship Diagram</h3>

<p>The following figure presents all the
Classes in DPRR’s ontology and shows how they relate to each other through <code>owl:ObjectProperties</code>.</p>

<a href="images/classDiagram.png" target="_blank"><img src="images/classDiagram.png" class="w3-border w3-padding" /></a>

<p>When studying this figure, you should first note that it is meant to be a
broad overview of the classes, and leaves out many
details.  For example, no <code>owl:DataProperties</code> are shown in the diagram, and the
SubClassing hierarchy is not fully shown either.  Nonetheless, a broad overview
is helpful if you are trying to grasp the structure overall.</p>

<p>First, about the legend.  As it tells you:</p>
<ul>
<li>the double-line arrows show Class-&gt;SubClass connections
between classes, with the arrow head placed at the SubClass end of each
connection.</li>

<li>the single line arrows show connections between Classes defined
by owl:ObjectProperties.  The name of the property is shown on each line, and
the arrow head end is the “range” part of the relationship.</li>

<li>a reader of the text that accompanies the previous Class Hierarchy figure
will have noted that there are three overarching categories of Classes. You can see this
reflected in the colour of the boxes representing the classes in this figure.
<ul>
<li>all those in
Brown are different kinds of Authority Lists,</li>

<li>all those in Red are different kinds of Assertions, and</li>

<li>all those in Green are different kinds of Notes or Note Containers.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h4>A Guided Tour</h4>

<p>The class relationship diagram just provided shows the classes in
the DPRR ontology as coloured boxes with two types of arrows connecting them. 
In this section, we will focus on the significance of the black, named, arrows,
which present Class connections expressed by the <code>owl:ObjectProperty</code> mechanism.
The reader may have noted the “:” before class names in this diagram.  This
implies the base URI prefix for DPRR’s ontology that applies to all the items
in the diagram: <a href="http://romanrepublic.ac.uk/rdf/ontology">http://romanrepublic.ac.uk/rdf/ontology#</a></p>

<p>In the ontology itself, this URI
is given the prefix “vocab:”, although in the following discussion the <i>vocab:</i>
prefix is left out purely for the sake of compactness.</p>

<p><b>Persons</b></p>

<p>DPRR is a prosopographical
project, so an important class is <i>:Person</i>, shown at the left side of the
diagram.  DPRR Persons have a rich set of <i>owl:DataProperties</i>, listed in
the section about :Person in the OWLDoc pages in
<a href="../ontology/doc">http://romanrepublic.ac.uk/rdf/ontology/doc</a>.  However, one can see in this
diagram that <i>:Person</i> also connects to several other data classes.  One
is <i>:Sex</i>, connected through the <i>:Person</i> property <i>:isSex</i>. 
By being coloured brown, we can see that <i>:Sex</i> is an Authority List. 
This bit of the diagram, then, is telling us that triples such as the following
exist in the repository:</p>

<p><code></code>&lt;http://romanrepublic.ac.uk/rdf/entity/Person/1&gt;
:isSex &lt;http://romanrepublic.ac.uk/rdf/entity/Sex/Male&gt;</code></p>

<p>Where <i>http://romanrepublic.ac.uk/rdf/entity/Person/1</i>
is a URI for a particular person in DPRR, and <i>http://romanrepublic.ac.uk/rdf/entity/Sex/Male</i>
is a particular Sex.</p>

<p>As with <i>:isSex</i> and <i>:Sex</i>,
we can also see connections between :Person and the <i>:Praenomen</i> entity. 
Roman naming conventions gave most males, and many females, a “Praenomen”,
which is one of a relatively short list of standard first names.  The set of Praenomena
used in DPRR is provided by the <i>:Praenomen</i> Authority list, and we can
see from the diagram that a Person will, in most cases, have one specified by
means of the <i>:hasPraenomen</i> property, and perhaps an alternative one via
the <i>:hasAltPraenomen</i> property.</p>

<p>DPRR has also attached notes,
often from secondary sources, about its persons. You can see the link from <i>:Person</i>
to <i>:PersonNote</i> through the property <i>:hasPersonNote</i>.  As it turns
out, any single person can have more than one <i>:PersonNote</i> linked through
multiple use of the <i>:hasPersonNote</i> property.  The possibility of
multiple occurrences of a property does not apply for all properties attached
to this or any other Class in DPRR, for example this possibility of multiple
references does not apply to the <i>:isSex</i> property in DPRR. Furthermore, the fact that
multiple occurrences of <i>:hasPersonNote</i> might occur, but only one <i>:isSex</i>
property is allowed is not shown in this figure.</p>

<p><b>Assertions</b></p>

<p>Most of the data for DPRR is made
up of assertions about persons.  As the relationship figure shows, there are several kinds of
assertions, all subclasses of the general <i>:Assertion</i> class.  Assertion
classes are shown in red boxes in the figure.  From <i>:Assertion</i> we can see that
a relationship is connected to <i>:Person</i> it is about through the <i>:isAboutPerson
</i>attribute.  Since this <i>owl:objectProperty</i> is defined for the <i>:Assertion</i>
class, we can infer that all its subclasses, e.g. <i>:DateInformation</i>, <i>:RelationshipAssertion</i>,
etc, also have this property, and can also use it to connect an assertion to
the relevant person to which it applies.</p>

<p>In DPRR most assertions come from
a secondary source.  Thus, one can see (perhaps with difficulty) an
owl:ObjectProperty called :hasSecondarySource that connects :Assertion to its
:SecondarySource.  See more about links between assertions and sources in the
section on Sources below.</p>

<p>Most types of Assertions in DPRR
connect a Person to a particular kind of associated Authority List.  <i>:PostAssertion</i>,
for instance, connects persons to offices, and you can see the property <i>:hasOffice</i>
connecting <i>:PostAssertion</i> to <i>:Office</i>.  This kind of structure
also applies to <i>:StatusAssertion</i> and <i>:TribeAssertion</i>.  <i>:RelationshipAssertion</i>,
by its very nature connects two people to a kind of relationship, not just one,
and you can see in the diagram that <i>:RelationshipAssertion</i> has not only
the <i>:isAboutPerson</i> property (that it inherits from its parent class <i>:Assertion</i>),
but also the <i>:hasRelatedPerson</i> property. If then, person A is son of
person B, A is the primary person connected from the <i>:RelationshipAssertion</i>
through the <i>:isAboutPerson</i> property, and B is the secondary person
connected through the <i>:hasRelatedPerson</i> property.  Many relationships
have an implied inverse relationship (if A is son of B, B is father of A), and
information about these inverses, as understood by DPRR, can be found in class <i>:RelationshipInverse</i>.</p>

<p>Two kinds of Assertions, <i>:StatusAssertion</i>
and <i>:PostAssertion</i> can have notes attached to them. <i><u>:StatusAssertion</u></i>
can have a <i>:StatusAssertionNote</i> connected through the <i>:hasStatusAssertionNote</i>
property.  As it turns out DPRR attached very few notes to Status Assertions. 
However, the <i>:hasPostAssertionNote</i> link between a <i>:PostAssertion</i>
and a <i>:PostAssertionNote</i> happens quite frequently since the main
secondary source for information about posts, Broughton, provides many notes.</p>

<p><i>:StatusAssertion</i> and <i>:PostAssertion</i>
also have date ranges that apply to them.  They thus are both subclasses of <i>:AssertionWithDateRange</i>,
which contains text and numeric properties that allow it to specify a date
range.</p>

<p><i>:DateInformation</i> is shown as a subclass of <i>:Assertion</i>, as indeed it is, but it
operates somewhat differently from the other Assertions in that its primary
function is not to connect persons to authority lists. Instead, it has <code>owl:DataProperties</code>
that allow life dates about a person to be asserted.  You can see details about
it in the detailed description of the class provided through OWLDoc <a href="/rdf/ontology/doc">here</a>.
There is a link to <code>:DateType</code> authority list, and it is used to allow
DPRR to specify the kind of life date that this particular one is.</p>

<p>There is are relationships
provided between status and post assertions to what Romans called a “Province”
&#x2014; often, but not necessarily, a geographical location to which the post or
status term applied.  <i>:Province</i> is the set of Provinces referenced by
DPRR.  The <i>:StatusAssertionProvince</i> class connects <i>:StatusAssertion</i>
to <i>:Province</i>, as the way to make the assertion, and similarly, the <i>:PostAssertionProvince</i>
class connects <i>:PostAssertion</i> to a province in <i>:Province</i>.</p>

<p>All assertions are backed up from
secondary sources.  The link from <i>:Assertion</i> is provided by <i>:hasSecondarySource</i>.</p>

<p><b>Authority Lists</b></p>

<p>As the Class hierarchy diagram
shows, DPRR authority lists are grouped broadly into two types, those with
abbreviations, and those with associated descriptive text (and one that has
neither: :Sex).  <i>(:Office</i> belongs to both groups). Two authority lists, <i>:Office</i>
and <i>:Province</i>, are internal hierarchical organisations, which is
expressed through their <i>:hasParent</i> property.</p>

<p><b>Sources</b></p>

<p>In the Class Relationships figure you can see that
both Primary and Secondary sources (<i>:PrimarySource</i> and <i>:SecondarySource</i>)
are subclassed from <i>:AuthorityWithAbbreviation</i>.  In addition to primary
name and abbreviation, however, both <i>:Source</i> types have provision to
support further bibiliographic data about the sources.  You can look up the details in the <a href="../ontology/doc/index.html">OWLDoc materials</a>.</p>

<p>DPRR has been built with the
purpose of bringing together primarily 20<sup>th</sup> and 21<sup>st</sup>
century prosopographical scholarship about the Roman Republic.  For this
reason, pretty well all the assertions made in DPRR come from one secondary
source or another, and hence there is a link from <i>:Assertion</i> to <i>:SecondarySource</i>
through the Assertion’s property <i>:hasSecondarySource</i>.</p>

<p>Although some structure has been
put in place to for primary historical sources, and in some cases the reference
to the primary source as provided by the secondary source has been harvested,
DRPP’s research team found that there was insufficient time to resolve these
references to actual Primary Source objects in <i>:PrimarySource</i>.  Thus,
this structure, although in place, should not at this time be expected to be
useful for queries against DPRR data, since it is essentially not populated
with data.</p>
