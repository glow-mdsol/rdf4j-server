      <h1 class="w3-text-teal" id="top">Why DPRR as RDF?</h1>
<p>According to Wikipedia (page: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linked_data">Linked Data</a>), Tim Berners Lee
coined the term &quot;linked data&quot; in 2006 in a document about the
Semantic Web project. Nonetheless Wikipedia goes on to cite Bizer, Heath and
Berners-Lee's 2009 paper entitled &quot;Linked Data: The Story So Far&quot; as a
source for its opening definition of Linked data:</p>

<blockquote>&quot;a method of publishing
structured data so that it can be interlinked and become more useful through
semantic queries. It builds upon standard Web technologies such as HTTP, RDF
and URIs, but rather than using them to serve web pages for human readers, it
extends them to share information in a way that can be read automatically by
computers. This enables data from different sources to be connected and
queried.&quot;</blockquote>

<h3 id="about">About DPRR</h3>
<p>Why is Linked Data relevant to the DPRR project? First of
all, I believe Linked and Open Data principles are particularly relevant to
DPRR because DPRR is a prosopography, and, generally speaking, I believe that
published prosopography offers an almost ideal kind of research that could be
expressed as linked data. There are two senses in which prosopography connects
with linked data's central principles.  First, because a prosopography aims to
develop the identity of their historical persons in a way that crosses multiple
historical sources, these identified historical people act, by their very
nature, as a kind of interlinking between these different sources.  Second, a
prosopography is, at least potentially, a global object &#x2014; something used by other
researchers throughout the world as a source for identities for historical
people.  The people-as-entities in a prosopography ideally have a global reach
and can thus play a part in the Global Graph that web folk, and those in the
Semantic Web and Linked Data in particular, talk about. For these reasons, it
seems to me that a prosopography forms the basis for a particularly rich and
interesting Linked Data kind of publication.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the <i>Digital Prosopography of the Roman
Republic </i>(DPRR), like DDH/CCH's many other prosopographical projects, is constructed
based on a representation of its materials in the form of highly structured
data. Indeed, like DDH/CCH’s other structured prosopographies, DPRR is built on
top of that quintessential highly structured paradigm: the relational database,
and as a result, DPRR’s historical research work has been already expressed in
terms of entities, attributes and relationships as they are thought of in the
relational data model. Since the Linked Data model is also based on the idea of
representing materials in the form of highly structured data that is accessible
globally, DPRR’s highly structured database would appear to fit well with it.</p>

<p>Although DPRR is like DDH/CCH's many other prosopographical
projects in that it takes a structured data rather than a narrative-article
based traditional prosopographical approach, it is unlike most of DDH’s others
in that DPRR is not structured as a factoid prosopography (Bradley 2017). Part
of the reason for its non-factoid approach is that, again unlike DDH/CCH’s
other prosopographical projects which worked directly with primary sources,
DPRR has been built primarily upon late 19<sup>th</sup>, 20<sup>th</sup> and 21<sup>st</sup>
century existing print and digital prosopographies; what we call here secondary
sources. What sources are used in DPRR?</p>

<p>Of all the prosopographical work available about the Roman
Republic T. Robert Broughton's study of office-holders (1951-2, supplement
1986) has been a primary resource work for historians since its creation. When
completed in the 1950s reviewers described it as: </p>
<ul>
<li>&quot;a valuable substitute for a full prosopography of the Roman
Republic&quot; in Bagnani's review in <i>Phoenix</i> Vol 7 No 4 (1953). pp
161-2</li>

<li>&quot;useful and extensive accomplishment in Republican
Prosopography&quot; in Adams's review in <i>American Journal of Archaeology</i>
, vol 58 No 2 (April 1954), p. 176</li>
</ul>

<p>All of the relevent bits of Broughton are fully included in the DPRR data. However, DPRR
is not only built upon the work and publications of Broughton.  In addition, DPRR
has arranged that more recent prosopographical work by Nicolet (on Roman
Knights), Rüpke (on Priests), Zmeskal (on Senators) and others should also be
included. Indeed more than 30 secondary sources are listed in DPRR’s database.
Thus, this is a further way in which DPRR acts as one kind of model for a
linked data project: it represent and links together this diverse range of
originally separate modern scholarly prosopographical publications on the Roman
republic, and does this via the historical people that appear in them.</p>

<h3 id="why">Why a DPRR RDF Server?</h3>
<p>We have already said that DPRR is built upon the relational
database &#x2014; and called this the “quintessential structured data paradigm”. Here,
however, we are talking about a linked data or semantic web representation of
DPRR’s materials, and although both linked data/semantic web technologies and
relational database technologies are built upon a shared basic conception of
highly structured data, they are not the same. What, then, is necessary to turn
DPRR’s already existing database-like structured materials into a publication that
fits the similar-but-different Linked Data model?  In order to think about this
most usefully, we need to understand the fundamental principles of Linked Data.</p>

<p>Tim Berners-Lee gave a presentation on linked data at the
TED 2010 conference. In it, he restated the linked data principles as three
&quot;extremely simple&quot; rules:</p>
<ul>
<li>&quot;All kinds of conceptual things, they have names now that start
with HTTP.</li>

<li>I get important information back. I will get back some data in a
standard format which is kind of useful data that somebody might like to know
about that thing, about that event.</li>

<li>I get back that information it's not just got somebody's height
and weight and when they were born, it's got relationships. And when it has
relationships, whenever it expresses a relationship then the other thing that
it's related to is given one of those names that starts with HTTP.&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p class=MsoNormal>More formally, Bizer, Heath and Berners-Lee's 2009 paper,
mentioned earlier, specify four criteria that Berners-Lee had described as a
“set of 'rules' for publishing data on the Web” in a way that all published
data becomes part of a single global data space. These four principles are
presented succinctly in Wikipedia’s “Linked Data” entry:</p>
<ol>
<li>Use URIs as names for things</li>

<li>Use HTTP URIs so that people can look up those names</li>

<li>When someone looks up a URI, provide useful information, using the standards (RDF,
SPARQL)</li>

<li>Include links to other URIs, so that they can discover more things.</li>
</ol>
<p>Rules one and two of these four seem to be met already by
DPRR’s existing web browser oriented web application at URL <a href="http://www.romanrepublic.ac.uk/">http://www.romanrepublic.ac.uk/</a>.
Rule one, for example: there is one publishable URL provided by the browser-oriented web
application for each person in DPRR, and it is a RESTful one (definition of
RESTful URL’s see Wikipedia’s definition
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer">here</a>). This URL, then,
could be interpreted as rule 1’s “URI” acting as a name for its person. 
Furthermore, if the existing web app is directly presented with this person’s
URL, the application will return back an HTML page containing the information
DPRR has about that person. Thus, as rule 2 requires, anyone with WWW access can
use this HTTP URI to look up that DPRR person. Furthermore, the generated DPRR
page provides, as rule 3 says, “useful information” about the entity it refers
to &#x2014; although, of course, the material is presented as an HTML page in a form
suitable for presentation by a web browser and is not delivered using the
semantic web standards of RDF. Finally, (rule 4) these generated web pages do
in fact contain links to other URIs within DPRR.</p>

<p>So, what’s missing from the existing DPRR web application
that is needed to make it more fully into a Linked Data application? The key
issue can be found in the second half of Wikipedia’s definition of linked data
&#x2014; items 3 and 4. As Bizer, Heath and Berners-Lee say, to operate as Linked
Data, the material has to presented “in a way that can be read automatically by
computers.” They then go on to say that this enables data from different
sources to be “appropriately connected and queried.&quot;  With the current
“browser oriented” web application the material is presented in terms of a HTML
web page suitable for reading by a human user, rather than in the form of formal
structured data. Of course, one <i>can</i> apply techniques called “screen scraping” to extract
the data from the presented web pages, but screen scraping is broadly
understood by its practitioners as awkward to do, and prone to error.  Thus,
when presented as a set of HTML web pages, DPRR’s data cannot readily be
processed, as data, by computers, and cannot readily be used as a source to be
connected, as data, with other sources.  This is why Bizer, Heath and
Berners-Lee attach an explicit reference to RDF in their rule 3. RDF is
described in its own documentation as a representation of a world-wide
“graph-based data model” (section 1.1, https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf11-concepts/). By
presenting the DPRR data in RDF, a language specifically designed for interlinking
between data that can operate potentially world-wide, and is then available for
further computer processing, one can present DPRR’s research materials as a
more satisfactory Linked Data source. </p>

<h3 id="building">Building the RDF</h3>
<p>The work described and referenced in these pages does
exactly this: it turns DPRR’s relational database which holds the intellectual
work embodied in DPRR into RDF, and then uses pieces of RDF-related technology
to deliver RDF over the internet to anyone that wants to use it. However, the
work done here goes further than just this. In addition:</p>
<ul>
<li>First, it provides access to RDF data using the query mechanism
specifically designed for selecting and processing RDF data: SPARQL (<a
href="http://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-query/">http://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-query/</a>). 
By providing a SPARQL endpoint, we are allowing users to select and order data
in DPRR in any way that a SPARQL query allows (subject, of course, to
length-of-time limitations for processing), and this, in turn, allows for a
much broader range of querying than DPRR’s current browser-oriented web
application data selection methods support. You can see how this can be exploited
in the <i>timeline</i> demonstration provided <a href="/rdf/timeline">here</a>.</li>

<li>Second, the work has resulted in the creation of a Semantic Web ontology
for DPRR &#x2014; a formal definition of the structure of DPRR’s data. Digital
Ontologies are important elements in the whole framework of Semantic Web
technologies that go beyond the more modest aims of Linked Data. They
provide mechanisms that, because of their formalism, allow the computer on its
own to better exploit the link between the structure of DPRR’s data and its
meaning in the world. And, indeed, DPRR’ s ontology does indeed allow some of
the Semantic Web’s ideas related to automatic reasoning to be exploited against
this data.  However, an ontology for DPRR has a further significant different
purpose: it makes it easier for human users to understand what kind of
information is in the set of RDF data for DPRR, and how it fits together. </li>
</ul>

<p>So, the work described here resulted in several products:</p>
<ol>
<li>The
DPRR Postgres relational database was translated into a sequence of RDF
triples,</li>

<li>The
triples were loaded into an RDF repository, and made available to the WWW via a
server,</li>

<li>DPRR’s
server was extended to support a SPARQL query frontend (a so-called SPARQL
endpoint), and</li>

<li>The
structure behind RDF’s triples has been defined in a basic Semantic Web OWL
ontology.</li>
</ol>

<p>The rest of this DPRR RDF site talks more about this work, and has three parts:</p>
<ul>
<li><i>Using DPRR’s RDF Server: </i>First, there is guidance on how
to use the DPRR RDF Linked Data server to get at, and query, DPRR materials (Tab "<a href="using.html">Using the Server</a>" (above)), and</li>

<li><i>Building DPRR’s RDF data and server:</i> there is an overview (Tab "<a href="building.html">Building the Server</a>") of how the RDF triples, repository/server and ontology
was created out of the DPRR database.</li>

<li><i>DPRR Ontology:</i> (Tab "<a href="ontology.html">DPRR Ontology</a>") presents an overview of DPRR's ontology. In addition to this, there is also a web-site presentation
of the ontology that was automatically generated by OWLDoc <a href="/rdf/ontology/doc">here</a>.</li>
